Extending the forest wildfire ABM model with more direct comparisons to human time and the multi-generational view that we may not see the full cycle. We may not live to see the forest reborn. 

The final extension is to include a model for soil loss. Our ancestors may not even remember us by the time the soil is able to recover from the losses of our era. 

I’d like to take Nicky Case’s existing model and find an interesting way to include a human timescale visualization. Ideally with the same emoji format of a variety of human characters aging over a series of “average” lifespans. It can be as hand wavy as the forest and fire model. The idea is more important than the precision.
