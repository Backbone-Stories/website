"For a truly gifted programmer, writing code is a side effect of thought. Their skill isn't in syntax, it's how they perceive time and computation. They can see the consequences of their actions more quickly than the next programmer; they spend less time in the dark. Their code still has bugs, it still needs to be optimized - they're not without flaws. But for every candle we own, they have three or four flashlights and a map." ~ Paul Ford gold
