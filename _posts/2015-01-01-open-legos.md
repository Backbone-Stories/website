The sound of raking through them.

Finding an old friends name taped to the back of a road plate. 

The instant reaction my son has to anything I've halfway built. 

That's the only audience I need. 

I want to go back to when I didn't even know I wanted likes or retweets or comments. Just building because it was fun. 

Each Git commit or social media post feels like a choice to expose a select and hopefully positive thing to the world. I don't post things that won't get liked. I don't go back and delete, but I definitely filter. We all do. 

Here's to throwing more things into the playground.
