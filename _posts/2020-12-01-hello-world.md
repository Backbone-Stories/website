It's trite to open a blog with an "Initial commit" style post, but I think I've finally got Jekyll reasonably configured and working! It only took a few weeks ðŸ˜‚ from when I first started poking around and joking about it on Twitter to now. Thankfully it was only a couple hours after work a few nights. 
My personal site has been static HTML and CSS for years now and my hope is now that I've got this running as a Github action on commit it'll keep working for... who am I kidding! I know I'll have to cajole this thing back to life whenever some upstream dependency changes. The hope is that keeping important writings (like this significant achievement here) in markdown files will make the eventual migration to the future easier.

I'm mostly writing all this to laugh at myself in the future.
