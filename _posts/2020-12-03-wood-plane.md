I love the closing story in this talk (about 33:00 in) from Erin Kissane about James Krenov:

> "When you have the right plane and you understand the wood and you slide the plane across the wood. The sound that comes across isn't just an ugly sound or a vibration, you're actually making music.
If you hear the music that means you're doing it right. You have the right system, the right wood, the right touch, you're making the right thing."

I'm a sucker for stories about woodworking but I'm trying to hold off from following down that rabbit hole as a hobby. The number of software developer souls lost to handcrafts is immense.
