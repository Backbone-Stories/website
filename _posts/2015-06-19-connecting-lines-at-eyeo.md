Eyeo ended a couple weeks in a beautiful send-off from Zach Lieberman. I‘ve gathered this fractured collection of tweets and links mainly for my own memory-making, but if you notice any glaring omissions please comment or tweet at me. The largest omission is of course the talks I missed while attending the alternate talk — my apologies to the speakers not listed here! The hope is to gather summaries for all the talks over the coming days. I can’t wait to watch the videos from all the talks once they’re online (promised to arrive sometime in July — we’re looking at you Dave☺).
