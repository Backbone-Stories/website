I'm [currently an iOS engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengoertz/) living in Portland, OR. Previously, I worked as a [video editor and producer](https://vimeo.com/92269602). My hope is to learn to blend the artistic with the technical: stories + code. For example, [this post about the Drake equation](https://bengoertz.com/2021/11/22/drake-equation/) has a small [Explorable Explanation](https://explorabl.es) section where you can try different values in the famous equation. 

I [try to write](/process) away from my computer whenever possible but here we are, reading and writing on glowing screens.

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suite22) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/suite22) if you'd rather speak in code.
